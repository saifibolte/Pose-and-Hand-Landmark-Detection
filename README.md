# Holistic Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use MediaPipe's Holistic solution to detect and visualize pose, face, and hand landmarks in real-time using a webcam feed. The program leverages OpenCV for capturing video and rendering the detected landmarks.

## Features
- Real-time pose, face, and hand landmark detection.
- Visualizes the detected landmarks using MediaPipe's `drawing_utils`.
- Easy-to-use and runs on any system with a webcam.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
